http://www.osgi.org[OSGi] R4 Http Service and Web Applications (OSGi Enterprise Release chapter 128) implementation using
http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty] {jettyVersion}, http://tomcat.apache.org[Tomcat] {tomcatVersion} or http://undertow.io[Undertow] {undertowVersion}.

Pax Web extends
OSGi Http Service with better
link:Http-Service-Extensions.html[servlet] support,
link:Http-Service-Extensions.html[filters],
link:Http-Service-Extensions.html[listeners],
link:Http-Service-Extensions.html[error pages] and
link:Http-Service-Extensions.html[JSPs] and some others in order
to meet the latest versions of Servlet specs.
Pax Web facilitates an easy installation of WAR bundles as well as
discovery of web elements published as OSGi services. All of this beside
the, standard, programmatic registration as detailed in the HTTP Service
specs.
